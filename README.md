=================================

Final Project for BMC CS245

This project was built off of a project started by Alcides Fonseca (amaf@student.dei.uc.pt, https://github.com/alcides/pascal-in-python). Fonseca created a parser and AST for Pascal and a function that  checked the syntax and return types of the AST. 

For my project I extended the original by replacing the check() with interpreter(). Interpreter() is the beginning portion of a functioning interpreter. It can successfully interpret, control statements, basic operations and writeln(). However, no other functions work at this time.
